# discord_bot_example

built with [discord.js v14](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)

some reference docs can be found here: [blog link](https://www.cnblogs.com/hhzm/)

remember to create a config.json in the project root directory to make it works!

config.json looks like this:
```
{  
   "token": "bot-token-goes-here",  
   "clientId": "bot-clientid-goes here",  
   "guildId": "serverid-goes-here"  
}
```
